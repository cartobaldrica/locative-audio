The Village of Shorewood has an optimal location for freshwater enthusiasts! The Village is bordered by two major bodies of water, the Milwaukee River and Lake Michigan, but unfortunately, that access comes at a cost. Pollution and flooding both present a problem in urban areas with numerous impervious surfaces. Therefore, the Village has adopted several practices to reduce the amount of pollution by runoff as well as managing stormwater issues. Stormwater is rain water that washes over the land collecting pollutants, trash, dog waste and chemicals. This can cause flooding, pollution, and erosion in areas surrounding natural bodies of water. Shorewood’s Water Walk showcases different practices implemented in the Village to combat and control excess stormwater by utilizing green infrastructure strategies. Let’s start our journey in Hubbard Park!","introduction.png"
